# 👋 Hey there, I’m Luca Nasser

I’m an undergraduate student in **Molecular Sciences** at the **University of São Paulo (USP)**, a program where physics, chemistry, biology, math, and computation constantly overlap.  
It’s the kind of place where one day you’re modeling protein folding and the next you’re simulating a Markov chain, and that mix is exactly what I love.  

I’m deeply fascinated by **computation, statistics, and mathematical modeling**, especially variable-order Markov chains, stochastic processes, and statistical inference.  
Lately, I’ve been shifting from a wet lab work toward **applied computational science and quantitative modeling**.

Beyond the lab and the terminal, I’m a nerd at heart, passionate about **Tolkien, fantasy literature, RPGs, and board games**.  

Like Frieren collecting spells no one else bothers to learn, I’m drawn to the quiet beauty of “useless” knowledge, things that seem trivial until they unexpectedly end up explaining something beautiful.

## 🧱 Stuff I Made

🧪 **UV & Fe Microbial Resistance Analysis**  
Reproducible Python toolkit for microbial stress experiments, automates everything from CFU/mL computation to log-linear and Weibull modeling, bootstrap uncertainty, and publication-ready figures.  
Originally developed to analyze my own experimental data at the **Astrobiology Laboratory (IQ-USP)**, it was designed to be reusable for future assays, whether in our lab or by other researchers.

📚 **Molecular Sciences Library**  
An open-source digital library **by students, for students** of the Molecular Sciences program.  
Initially created by me and a classmate, we not only built the code but also manually re-labeled and cataloged the entire physical collection into a structured database.  
Built with React, Express, SQLite, and Docker, the system manages real-world book loans, virtual shelves, notifications, and contribution badges, all live at [**bibliotecamoleculares.com**](https://bibliotecamoleculares.com).  
The platform was designed so future students can maintain and expand it, keeping the library a living, evolving project.

🧬 **Fitness Landscape Simulator**  
Java + Python project modeling two-locus fitness landscapes under epistasis.
Produces and visualizes fitness surfaces, evolutionary trajectories, and χ² analyses.
Developed for a Computational Science course, it explores how simple simulations can capture the dynamics behind evolutionary interactions.
