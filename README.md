# 👋 Hey there, I’m Luca Nasser

I’m an undergraduate student in **Molecular Sciences** at the **University of São Paulo (USP)** — an interdisciplinary program bridging physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and computer science.  
It’s the kind of course where you might start modeling protein folding and end up simulating Markov chains. That’s exactly what I love about it.  

I’m deeply fascinated by **computation, statistics, and mathematical modeling**, especially variable-order Markov chains, stochastic processes, and statistical inference.  
Lately, I’ve been shifting from pure academia toward **applied computational science and quantitative modeling**.

Beyond the lab and the terminal, I’m a nerd at heart, passionate about **Tolkien, fantasy literature, RPGs, and board games**.  

Like Frieren collecting spells that no one else bothers to learn, I’m drawn to the quiet beauty in “useless” knowledge — bits of math, code, or data that seem trivial until they unexpectedly illuminate something greater.
