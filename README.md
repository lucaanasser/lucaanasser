## 👋 Hey there, I’m Luca Nasser

I’m an undergraduate student in **Molecular Sciences** at the **University of São Paulo (USP)**, a program where physics, chemistry, biology, math, and computation constantly overlap. It’s the kind of place where one day you’re modeling protein folding and the next you’re simulating a Markov chain, and that mix is exactly what I love.  

I’m deeply fascinated by **computation, statistics, and mathematical modeling**, especially variable-order Markov chains, stochastic processes, and statistical inference.  
Lately, I’ve been shifting from a wet lab work toward **applied computational science and quantitative modeling**.

Outside the lab and code, I enjoy **Tolkien, fantasy literature, RPGs, and board games**—always chasing the quiet beauty of seemingly “useless” knowledge.


### 🧱 Stuff I Made

🧪 **UV & Fe Microbial Resistance Analysis**  
Reproducible Python toolkit for microbial stress experiments, automates everything from CFU/mL computation to log-linear, bootstrap uncertainty and publication-ready figures.  
Originally developed to analyze my own experimental data at the **Astrobiology Laboratory (IQ-USP)**, it was designed to be reusable for future assays, whether in our lab or by other researchers.

📚 **Molecular Sciences Library**  
Open-source digital library **by students, for students**. Built with React, Express, SQLite, and Docker, managing book loans, virtual shelves, and notifications, live at [**bibliotecamoleculares.com**](https://bibliotecamoleculares.com). 
My classmate and I not only coded the platform but manually re-labeled and cataloged the entire physical collection.

🧬 **Fitness Landscape Simulator**  
Java + Python project modeling two-locus fitness landscapes under epistasis. Visualizes fitness surfaces, evolutionary trajectories, and χ² analyses. Developed for a Computational Science course.
